# GxEPD2
## Arduino Display Library for SPI E-Paper Displays

- With full Graphics and Text support using Adafruit_GFX

- For SPI e-paper displays from Dalian Good Display 
- and SPI e-paper boards from Waveshare

### important note:
- the display panels are for 3.3V supply and 3.3V data lines
- never connect data lines directly to 5V Arduino data pins, use e.g. 4k7/10k resistor divider
- series resistor only is not enough for reliable operation (back-feed effect through protection diodes)
- 4k7/10k resistor divider may not work with flat cable extensions or Waveshare 4.2 board, use level converter then
- do not forget to connect GND
- the actual Waveshare display boards now have level converters and series regulator, safe for 5V
- use 3k3 pull-down on SS for ESP8266 for boards with level converters
- note that 7.5" e-paper displays don't work reliable if fed from 3.3V Arduino pin
- note that Waveshare boards with "clever" reset circuit may need shortened reset pulse
- use `init(115200, true, 2, false)` for Waveshare boards with "clever" reset circuit
- note that Waveshare boards with "clever" reset circuit need 1k pull-up on RST on ESP8266, or different pin
- note that the new Waveshare Universal e-Paper Raw Panel Driver HAT Rev 2.3 needs PWR connected to VCC or driven HIGH
- see https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/E-Paper_Driver_HAT

### Paged Drawing, Picture Loop
 - This library uses paged drawing to limit RAM use and cope with missing single pixel update support
 - buffer size can be selected in the application by template parameter page_height, see GxEPD2_Example
 - Paged drawing is implemented as picture loop, like in U8G2 (Oliver Kraus)
 - see https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki/tpictureloop
 - Paged drawing is also available using drawPaged() and drawCallback(), like in GxEPD
- ` // GxEPD style paged drawing; drawCallback() is called as many times as needed `
- ` void drawPaged(void (*drawCallback)(const void*), const void* pv) `
- paged drawing is done using Adafruit_GFX methods inside picture loop or drawCallback

### Full Screen Buffer Support
 - full screen buffer is selected by setting template parameter page_height to display height
 - drawing to full screen buffer is done using Adafruit_GFX methods without picture loop or drawCallback
 - and then calling method display()

### Low Level Bitmap Drawing Support
 - bitmap drawing support to the controller memory and screen is available:
 - either through the template class instance methods that forward calls to the base display class
 - or directly using an instance of a base display class and calling its methods directly

### Supporting Arduino Forum Topics:

- Waveshare e-paper displays with SPI: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=487007.0
- Good Display ePaper for Arduino : https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=436411.0
- Note that these topics are closed. Use only for reference.
- The Arduino Forum is no longer watched and answered by the Author.
- New questions or issues should be posted on https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2/discussions

### Note on documentation
- GxEPD2 uses Adafruit_GFX for Graphics and Text support, which is well documented there
- GxEPD2 uses meaningful method names, and has some comments in the header files
- consult the header files GxEPD2_BW.h, GxEPD2_3C.h and GxEPD2_GFX.h
- for the concept of paged drawing and picture loop see: 
- https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki/tpictureloop

### Note on issues and pull requests
- issues should be reported in the Arduino Forum Displays.
- issues on GitHub are disabled; there were too many false issues.
- pull requests are not welcome, will not be merged.
- pull requests can't be disabled, but will be closed.
- please place information about interesting fork additions in the Arduino Forum Displays.

### I can and will only support e-paper panels I have!
- I can accept panel donations to add support to GxEPD2.
- But only few panels at any time, and only panels from known sources. 
- Adding support will take as much time as needed.

#### Version 1.1.8
- fix for incomplete download in GxEPD2_WiFi_Example
- added missing method displayWindow() to GxEPD2_GFX base class
- fix and clean up of initial refresh for panels with differential update

- note: 5V supply needs to be exact and strong; 5V over diode from USB (e.g. Wemos D1 mini) doesn't work!
- note that the IT8951 Driver HAT is panel specific, with flash parameterized by supplier
- this is an initial version
#### Version 1.1.4+
